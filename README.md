## 🔑 Executive Summary
This project demonstrates how to use **Python for interacting with web APIs**, processing responses, and creating meaningful visualizations. The examples use GitHub’s API, Hacker News, and the National Vulnerability Database (NVD), but the same workflow is directly applicable to cybersecurity operations:

- Automating **vulnerability intelligence** collection from APIs.
- Parsing and analyzing **JSON data** from threat intelligence feeds.
- Visualizing **trending CVEs, attack surfaces, or incident metrics**.
- Building **repeatable, testable Python scripts** for security workflows.

👉 For recruiters and hiring managers: this project highlights my ability to **query APIs, handle real-world data, and visualize security trends** in ways that are critical to threat monitoring and compliance reporting.

## 📌 Overview

Key lessons explored in this project:

- Making **HTTP requests** with Python’s `requests` library.
- Handling JSON response objects and error codes.
- Summarizing API data (e.g., top GitHub repositories).
- Monitoring and respecting **API rate limits**.
- Creating visualizations with **Plotly** (interactive bar charts with tooltips, links, and custom styling).
- Querying multiple APIs, including the **Hacker News API** and **NIST NVD API**.

---

## 🧠 Skills & Concepts

- Working with REST APIs (`requests`, JSON parsing).
- Data processing with Python dictionaries & lists.
- API rate limiting and error handling.
- Visualization with **Plotly** (interactive charts).
- Testing with **pytest** for API response validation.
- Applying results to **cybersecurity use cases** (CVE monitoring, threat dashboards).

## 📊 Exercises Implemented

**17-1: Other Languages** → Visualized most popular projects in non-Python languages (JS, Ruby, Go, etc.).

**17-2: Active Discussions** → Bar chart of top Hacker News threads by comment count, with clickable links.

**17-3: Testing GitHub API Calls** → Used pytest to confirm status codes and API response properties.

**17-4: Further Exploration (Cybersecurity)** → Queried NIST NVD API for latest CVEs, filtered for “Analyzed,” and plotted CVSS 3.1 scores by severity band (Low/Medium/High/Critical) with custom tooltips.
